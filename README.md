# Library Checker

A small project to check availability of shelved books from good reads in your local library (if your local library is in the minuteman library network ;) ).

## Use

Goodreads does not support API access (LINK HERE), so you'll need to export your data. Follow instructions (LINK HERE) to do so.


## Technical Description

### CSV
For fun, I decided to write my own little csv parser for this project. It's in `csv.ts`.
